Product Overview
----------------
The game, "Room Service, Please," is a 2D 16-bit platform. The setting takes place in an
abandonded hotel in which the player must try to escape. The player will encounter many 
challenges in order to escape, which requires defeating enemies and finding specific items
that will aid the player in escaping. 

The following instructions are to help install the necessary software to begin the process 
of testing the prototype of the game. It will be assumed that testers outside of the JAZ group
will already have a github account; however, the document will provide an outline of how to 
use github to get the code onto the tester's computer. 


Software Requirements
---------------------
Operating System for testing environment: Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 8.1

Software Tools:
  **Software         	- Version	      - Source                     	  - Description**
- Flash Develop	      - 4.4.1	        - http://flashdevelop.org	      - The IDE used to program the software.
- Adobe Flash Player	- 17.0.0.134	  - http://adobe.com	            - For being able to run and test the software.
- Adobe Flex SDK	    - 4.6	          - http://adobe.com	            - The developer tools to compile actionscript 3 code.


Accessing the Prototype
-----------------------
From the J-A-Z RoomServicePlease repository page, download the .ZIP file, save to computer, and extract the files. 
If using GitBash or the command line, the cloning URL is: https://github.com/J-A-Z/RoomServicePlease.git

To begin, ensure that the software requirements are met before continuing. Once these conditions have been met, 
open the Flash Develop application. On the right-hand side of the application are options to "Create a new project"
or "Open an existing project" or "Import a Flex Builder project." Select "Open an existing project" and locate the 
extracted files. When the file is found, select the "Game.as3proj" file to open. Once you have opened the project, 
click on the run button found at on the tool bar (this is similar to Eclipse). When the program is compiled, the 
game will be displayed after the adobe flash debugger is initialized. 


Coding History
--------------
Coding for this project is currently in phase 1, which entails all the graphical user interfaces and ensuring the basic
functionality has been completed. Phase 2 will include enhanced updates so that the user may report bugs, save the file
to the computer, and load the saved file. Phase 3 will occur when a user reports a bug that needs to be fixed by the JAZ
team. 


Known Bugs
----------
There are currently no known bugs for this project as of April 17, 2015. This is subject to change.
